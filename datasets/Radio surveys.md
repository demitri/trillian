### Radio surveys

VLA - [FIRST](http://sundog.stsci.edu/first/images.html) (designed to cover SDSS footprint), [NVSS](http://www.cv.nrao.edu/nvss/) (everything north of -40 dec) - on Vizier, both have images

[GMRT 150 MHz all sky survey](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv160304368I) - author: H. Intema



FIRST - Bob Becker (Q: coadds? individual images? )

NVSS - Jim Conden / only single images available

Image cubes - each frequency band has a plane

Southern key

* SUMSS - Sydney University X Survey
* AT20G Survey



* [High-resolution Very Large Array Imaging of Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82 at 1.4 GHz](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AJ....142....3H) Jacqueline Hodge et al. - 2011 paper, 2015 reference on Vizier - same frequency as FIRST, much deeper, better resolution, specifically to cover Stripe 82.

Best to start: FIRST, NVSS

Above are mostly interferometry (simulate one big dish, but missing data)

measuring fourier transform - missing some scales of emission - insensitive to constant surface brightness value 

Radio galaxies/AGN can get chopped up into multiple small sources since not sensitive to large scale emission

Radio loud AGN can have multiple sources (e.g. triple: core + two lobes) -> hard to determine what is a real source versus what is just a component.

Radio Galaxy Zoo - trying to solve the problem of multiple components, Kevin Schewinski - WISE + radio from various catalogs. 

Amy produced a component catalog.

Majority are single sources - don't see lobe emission as it's too far away (~90%).

Different surveys can have very different angular resolution. Different configurations will result in different resolution & astrometric accuracy. Amy used different resolutions to associate components with sources.

Radio lobes can extend 1-1.5 pc beyond (optical) galaxy.

1/3 of radio sources that don't have coutnerparts b/c we don't have enough depth to see them.

Some have only one lobe detected - one lobe or another source nearby. Catalogs are being used, not images.

[Condon et al. 2013](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1303.3448) - NVSS 5Ïƒ cutoff - went back to SDSS, statistically got emission from quasar by looking at individual pixels. no one has looked for IR, optical emission starting from radio sources.

Emission is coming from synchrotron - something bright goes to higer and higher frequencies. What's the upper limit?

NVSS :

I image : full intensity (emission)

q, u : polarization (for polarization, wait for VLA sky survey - need a really high s/n to measure polarization)
